# Prisoners' Dilemma Simulations

This project runs simulations of iterated Prisoners' Dilemma for players with different strategies. The strategies were inspired by Nicky Case's game [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/). The results of these simulations were used in my research project.
